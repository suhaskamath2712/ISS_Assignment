Parallelization of KMeans Clustering using OpenMP (5 points)

Explore and write a sequential program for K-Means clustering, where
the input data is a set of 2D (x,y) data points given in the link below.

Parallelize the loops of the clustering using OpenMP.

Perform experiments comparing the execution time of OpenMP and the
sequential codes. For this assignment, we will use K=20 for the number
of clusters. Your program should output 20 lines, each for a cluster
formed, containing the fields: cluster index, number of points in the
cluster and centroid of the points in the cluster.. Perform the following
explorations:

Static vs dynamic schedule clause in OpenMP for loop
Perform experiments for OpemMP threads - 4, 8, 16 and 32.

For each experiment with a fixed number of threads, and for the sequential
program, run 5 times, and obtain the average execution time across these 5 runs.

Prepare a report containing:
Methodology
Experimental setup
Results containing execution times and speedup with the above options,
both as tables and graphs with x and y axes properly labeled.
Observations.
