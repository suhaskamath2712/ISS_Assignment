**Memory Bandwidth Evolution in Architectures**

According to Moore's Law, CPU compute doubles approximately every 18 months, while memory bandwidth improves at only ~7% per year, creating a growing "memory wall" bottleneck. Write a report on how memory bandwidth has evolved in CPU and GPU architectures over the past decade. Trace memory bandwidth evolution (GB/s, bandwidth-per-TFLOP, compute-to-memory ratios etc.) and technology transitions (GDDR5 → GDDR6/GDDR6X → HBM2/HBM3, bus width changes etc.).

**Chiplet Architecture and Heterogeneous Integration**

Chiplet-based architectures have emerged as the dominant paradigm for high-performance computing. Investigate chiplet design methodologies and heterogeneous integration strategies from three industry leaders (AMD, Intel, and NVIDIA).

While it is given that you will be referring to various sources, the report has to be in your own words. Diagrams from other sources may be used, but they should be properly cited at the bottom of the figures. We will use Turnitin, and viva evaluation to ensure that the report is not a simple copy-paste from other sources and AI generated.
