Sparse matrix-vector multiplication using MPI (5 points)

Write a MPI-based sparse matrix-vector multiplication. For this program,
use the sparse matrix from SparseSuite  that is set up in a common area
on the teaching cluster. The sparse matrix is a 27,993,600 x 27,993,600
matrix with 760,648,352 non-zeros that are real numbers.

Execute the following commands
>> bash /scratch/public/sparse_matrix_data/setup.sh
>> make test

The first command will generate a couple of cpp files, header file and
Makefile. Go through the main.cpp for an example on how to load the matrix
and vector. The second command is for compiling the program.

Your parallel program should be written in a way to attempt to load balance
the computations across the processes. Run your parallel matrix-multiplication
program with 8, 16, 32, 64 and 128 processes. For each experiment with a fixed
number of threads, and for the sequential program, run 5 times, and obtain the
average execution time across these 5 runs.

Prepare a report containing:
•     Methodology
•     Experimental setup
•     Results
•     Give observations on each of these results.

For each process run (8, 16, etc.), show the execution times and speedups when
compared to single-process execution, both as tables and graphs.

For each process run (8, 16, etc.), find the measure of load imbalance as
(maximum time spent by a process – minimum time spent by a process) / (minimum time spent by a process).
For measuring these times, find the time spent only on the computations by each
process. Plot these load imbalance measures.

For the 64-process execution, plot the computation times spent on each of the 64 processes.
